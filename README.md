📄 Customer Churn Classification: Problem Overview

🧩 1. Problem Statement
In a highly competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is just as important—if not more so—than acquiring new ones. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a provider.

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn, based on their usage behavior, service preferences, and demographics. Accurate churn prediction enables the company to proactively take steps to retain customers, such as offering incentives, improved support, or personalized deals.

📦 2. Dataset Description
The dataset provided includes 7,043 customer records from a telecom company, with the following features:

Demographic features: gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents

Account info: tenure, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod

Service usage: InternetService, StreamingTV, TechSupport, etc.

Billing info: MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

Target variable: Churn – indicating if the customer has left (Yes) or stayed (No)

🧠 3. Objective
To develop a binary classification model that can accurately predict churn (Yes/No), and evaluate it using key metrics like:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

🔍 4. Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for modeling:

Converted TotalCharges to numeric and handled missing values.

Removed the customerID column (non-informative).

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Split data into training and test sets (80/20).

🏗️ 5. Model Building
We explored multiple models:

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier (yielded the best results)

We evaluated model performance using:

Confusion Matrix: visualized via heatmap

Accuracy: proportion of total correct predictions

Precision: how many of the predicted churns were actual churns

Recall: how many actual churns were correctly predicted

🎯 6. Results
After optimization with XGBoost:

Accuracy ≈ 78–80%

Precision ≈ 62–65%

Recall ≈ 47–50%

A confusion matrix heatmap was used to understand true positives, false positives, etc.

💡 7. Business Impact
With a reliable churn prediction model:

The company can target high-risk customers with retention offers.

Reduces customer acquisition cost (CAC) by focusing on customer lifetime value (CLV).

Improves overall customer satisfaction and loyalty by addressing issues proactively.

✅ 8. Conclusion
Churn prediction provides powerful insights into customer behavior. While the current model performs reasonably well, further improvements like:

Including customer support data or call logs

Time-series analysis

SMOTE for handling class imbalance
